# LaLeet-Shia-LaCode

## About

This repository contains my personal solutions to selected LeetCode problems. It includes only problems where I believe my solution or proof offers more than what you can typically find on the internet — whether through a clean proof, strong readability, or an efficient algorithmic approach.

All solutions are self-authored (**not generated by AI** or automated tools) and focus on the core idea and correctness.  
While comments are generally discouraged in practice, these solutions include them when they emphasize reasoning or proof. They focus on the 'why' rather than the 'what'.

## Reservations

LeetCode-style challenges often focus exclusively on algorithmic problem-solving, while other **equally important** real-world factors —maintainability, readability, SOLID principles, and documentation— receive little consideration. In the age of AI-assisted development, clear documentation and well-structured code are just as critical as algorithmic efficiency.

Accordingly, these solutions avoid overly clever tricks or low-level optimizations that sacrifice readability, favoring code that resembles real-world production quality.
